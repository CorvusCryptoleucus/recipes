    <h1>Thick Crust Pizza Dough Recipe</h1>
<p><strong>Yield:</strong> 2 medium pizzas (one now, one later)</p>
<hr />
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
<li>450 g (3 ¾ cups) all-purpose flour</li>
<li>9 g (1 ½ teaspoons) salt</li>
<li>12 g (1 tablespoon) sugar</li>
<li>7 g (2 ¼ teaspoons) instant yeast</li>
<li>300 ml (1 ¼ cups) warm water (about 45°C / 110°F)</li>
<li>45 ml (3 tablespoons) olive oil (plus extra for greasing)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<h3>1. Activate the Yeast:</h3>
<ul>
<li>In a small bowl, combine the warm water and sugar.</li>
<li>Sprinkle the yeast over the top and let it sit for 5–10 minutes until foamy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Mix the Dry Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make a well in the center of the flour mixture.</li>
<li>Pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.</li>
<li>Stir until a sticky dough forms.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Knead the Dough:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface.</li>
<li>Knead for about 8–10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.</li>
<li>If the dough is too sticky, add more flour a tablespoon at a time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Let the Dough Rise:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lightly grease a large bowl with olive oil.</li>
<li>Place the dough in the bowl, turning to coat it with oil.</li>
<li>Cover with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap.</li>
<li>Let it rise in a warm place for 1–1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Divide the Dough:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Punch down the risen dough and divide it in half.</li>
<li>Use one portion for the pizza you’re making now.</li>
<li>Shape the remaining half into a ball, lightly coat it with olive oil, and place it in an airtight container or zip-top bag.</li>
<li>Store it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 3 months.</li>
<li>(If freezing, thaw overnight in the fridge before using.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Prepare the Pizza:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Preheat your oven to 245°C / 475°F.</li>
<li>Roll out the dough for your first pizza to your desired thickness.</li>
<li>Place it on a greased or parchment-lined pizza pan.</li>
<li>Add your favorite sauce, cheese, and toppings.</li>
</ul>
<h3>8. Bake:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bake for 12–15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling.</li>
<li>For extra crispiness, bake on a lower rack or preheated pizza stone.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9. Store Leftover Dough:</h3>
<ul>
<li>When ready to use the second portion, allow it to come to room temperature (about 30 minutes) before shaping and baking.</li>
</ul>
<h3>10. Enjoy:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Let the baked pizza cool slightly before slicing and serving.</li>
</ul>
