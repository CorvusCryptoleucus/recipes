    <h1>Taco Bell-Style Hash Browns</h1>
<p><strong>Servings:</strong> ~6 hash brown patties</p>
<hr />
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>450 g (1 lb)</strong> russet potatoes</li>
<li><strong>30 g (2 tbsp)</strong> all-purpose flour (or gluten-free flour)</li>
<li><strong>15 ml (1 tbsp)</strong> vegetable oil (for mixing)</li>
<li><strong>2.5 g (1/2 tsp)</strong> garlic powder</li>
<li><strong>2.5 g (1/2 tsp)</strong> onion powder</li>
<li><strong>1.25 g (1/4 tsp)</strong> smoked paprika (optional)</li>
<li><strong>2.5 g (1/2 tsp)</strong> salt (adjust to taste)</li>
<li><strong>1.25 g (1/4 tsp)</strong> black pepper</li>
<li><strong>Vegetable oil for frying</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<h3>Prepare the Potatoes</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Peel and Grate</strong><br />
   Peel the russet potatoes and grate them using a box grater. Transfer the grated potatoes to a bowl of cold water and let sit for 5-10 minutes to remove excess starch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rinse and Drain</strong><br />
   Drain the potatoes and rinse under cold water until the water runs clear. Transfer the grated potatoes to a clean kitchen towel or cheesecloth, then squeeze out as much water as possible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3>Mix the Hash Brown Base</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Combine Ingredients</strong><br />
   In a large mixing bowl, combine the grated potatoes, flour, vegetable oil, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika (if using), salt, and black pepper. Mix until evenly combined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shape the Patties</strong><br />
   Divide the mixture into 6 equal portions. Shape each portion into a rectangular or oval patty, about 1 cm (1/3 inch) thick.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3>Cook the Hash Browns</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Heat the Oil</strong><br />
   In a large skillet, heat vegetable oil over medium heat. Add enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan, about 2-3 mm (1/8 inch) deep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fry the Hash Browns</strong><br />
   Place the patties in the hot oil, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Fry for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Drain the Hash Browns</strong><br />
   Transfer the cooked hash browns to a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3>Serve</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Enjoy Warm</strong><br />
   Serve immediately as a side dish or include them in breakfast burritos or sandwiches for an authentic Taco Bell-inspired experience.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Air Fryer Option:</strong> Preheat your air fryer to 200°C (400°F). Spray the patties with oil and cook for 10-12 minutes, flipping halfway through.</li>
<li><strong>Make Ahead:</strong> Freeze uncooked patties on a baking sheet. Once frozen, store in an airtight container. Cook directly from frozen by frying or air frying.</li>
</ul>
