## Instructions

### Make the Dough
1. **Prepare the base**  
   In a medium saucepan, combine water, vegan butter, sugar, and salt. Heat over medium heat, stirring, until the mixture comes to a boil.

2. **Add the flour**  
   Reduce the heat to low and add the flour all at once. Stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until the mixture forms a smooth dough that pulls away from the sides of the pan.

3. **Incorporate vanilla and eggs**  
   Remove the pan from heat and let the dough cool for 5 minutes. Stir in vanilla extract. Add the eggs (or aquafaba) one at a time, mixing thoroughly after each addition until the dough is smooth and glossy.

4. **Prepare the piping bag**  
   Transfer the dough to a piping bag fitted with a large star tip.

### Fry the Churros
5. **Heat the oil**  
   Heat 5 cm (2 inches) of oil in a deep skillet or pot to 180°C (350°F).

6. **Pipe the churros**  
   Pipe 10-15 cm (4-6 inch) strips of dough into the hot oil, using scissors or a knife to cut the dough at the tip. Fry 3-4 churros at a time to avoid overcrowding.

7. **Cook the churros**  
   Fry the churros for 2-3 minutes per side, until golden brown and crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a plate lined with paper towels.

### Coat the Churros

   Roll the warm churros in the cinnamon sugar mixture until fully coated.
