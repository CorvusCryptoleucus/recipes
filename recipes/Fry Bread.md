# Fry Bread

## Ingredients
- **500 g (4 cups)** all-purpose flour
- **7 g (2 tsp)** baking powder
- **5 g (1 tsp)** salt
- **5 g (1 tsp)** sugar
- **240 ml (1 cup)** warm water
- **15 ml (1 tbsp)** vegetable oil
- **Vegetable oil** for frying (enough to fill a skillet about 1–2 inches deep)

## Instructions
1. **Mix the Dough**  
   - In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar (if using).  
   - Add the warm water (or milk) and oil (if using). Mix until the dough comes together. If the dough feels too sticky, add a little more flour; if it’s too dry, add a small amount of water.

2. **Knead the Dough**  
   - Knead the dough on a floured surface for 2–3 minutes, or until it is smooth and pliable. Do not over-knead; fry bread dough should remain soft.

3. **Rest the Dough**  
   - Cover the dough with a damp towel and let it rest for 30 minutes. This helps the gluten relax, making the bread easier to shape.

4. **Shape the Dough**  
   - Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball, then flatten it into a disc about 6–8 inches in diameter and 1/4 inch thick. For authentic fry bread, you can use your hands to stretch and shape the dough.

5. **Heat the Oil**  
   - Heat 1–2 inches of vegetable oil in a deep skillet or frying pan over medium-high heat. The oil should reach **190°C (375°F)**. Test the oil with a small piece of dough; it should sizzle and float to the top.

6. **Fry the Bread**  
   - Carefully place one piece of dough into the hot oil. Fry for 1–2 minutes per side, or until golden brown and puffed. Use tongs to flip the bread and ensure even cooking.  
   - Remove from the oil and drain on a plate lined with paper towels.

7. **Serve**  
   - Serve warm with toppings such as honey, powdered sugar, or jam for a sweet treat. For savory applications, use it as a base for taco fillings or stews.
