## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Tofu:**  
   - Press the tofu to remove excess moisture.  
   - Cut it into bite-sized cubes.  
   - Toss the tofu cubes in cornstarch until they are evenly coated.

2. **Cook the Tofu:**  
   - Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Spray with olive oil.  
   - Add the tofu cubes in a single layer and cook for 2–3 minutes on each side until crispy and golden brown.  
   - Remove the tofu from the skillet and set aside.

3. **Sauté the Vegetables:**  
   - In the same skillet, add a little more olive oil spray.  
   - Add the frozen 3 pepper and onion blend. Stir-fry for 3–5 minutes until the vegetables are soft and lightly browned.

4. **Make the Sauce:**  
   - In a small bowl, mix the soy sauce, vegetable broth, brown sugar, garlic powder, ginger powder, chili powder, ground coriander, cinnamon, and black pepper. Stir well to combine.  
   - Pour the sauce into the skillet with the vegetables.  
   - Bring to a simmer and cook for 1–2 minutes until the sauce starts to thicken.

5. **Combine Everything:**  
   - Return the crispy tofu to the skillet and toss to coat evenly in the sauce.  
   - Cook for another 1–2 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.

6. **Garnish and Serve:**  
   - Sprinkle with sesame seeds for a finishing touch.  
   - Serve hot over jasmine rice or long-grain white rice.
