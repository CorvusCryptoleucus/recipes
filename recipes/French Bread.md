# French Bread Recipe

## Ingredients
- **500 g (4 cups)** all-purpose flour (or bread flour for extra chewiness)
- **10 g (2 tsp)** salt
- **7 g (2 tsp)** sugar
- **7 g (2 1/4 tsp)** active dry yeast
- **300 ml (1 1/4 cups)** warm water (40°C/105°F)
- **10 ml (2 tsp)** olive oil (optional, for a softer crust)

## Instructions
1. **Activate the Yeast**  
   - In a small bowl, mix the yeast and sugar with warm water. Let it sit for 5–10 minutes until frothy.

2. **Mix and Knead**  
   - In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt.  
   - Add the activated yeast mixture and olive oil (if using) to the flour.  
   - Mix until a dough forms, then knead on a floured surface for 8–10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic.

3. **First Rise**  
   - Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for 1–1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.

4. **Shape the Loaves**  
   - Punch down the dough and divide it into two equal parts.  
   - Shape into long loaves (baguette-style) or round loaves. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet and score the tops with a sharp knife.

5. **Second Rise**  
   - Cover with a towel and let it rise for another 30–45 minutes.

6. **Preheat the Oven**  
   - Preheat to **230°C (450°F)**. Place a shallow pan of water on the bottom rack for steam.

7. **Bake**  
   - Bake for 20–25 minutes, or until golden brown and the loaves sound hollow when tapped.
