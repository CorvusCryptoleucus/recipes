# Thick Crust Pizza Dough Recipe

**Yield:** 2 medium pizzas (one now, one later)

## Ingredients:
- 450 g (3 ¾ cups) all-purpose flour
- 9 g (1 ½ teaspoons) salt
- 12 g (1 tablespoon) sugar
- 7 g (2 ¼ teaspoons) instant yeast
- 300 ml (1 ¼ cups) warm water (about 45°C / 110°F)
- 45 ml (3 tablespoons) olive oil (plus extra for greasing)

## Instructions:

### 1. Activate the Yeast:
- In a small bowl, combine the warm water and sugar.
- Sprinkle the yeast over the top and let it sit for 5–10 minutes until foamy.

### 2. Mix the Dry Ingredients:
- In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.

### 3. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:
- Make a well in the center of the flour mixture.
- Pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.
- Stir until a sticky dough forms.

### 4. Knead the Dough:
- Turn the dough out onto a floured surface.
- Knead for about 8–10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.
- If the dough is too sticky, add more flour a tablespoon at a time.

### 5. Let the Dough Rise:
- Lightly grease a large bowl with olive oil.
- Place the dough in the bowl, turning to coat it with oil.
- Cover with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap.
- Let it rise in a warm place for 1–1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.

### 6. Divide the Dough:
- Punch down the risen dough and divide it in half.
- Use one portion for the pizza you’re making now.
- Shape the remaining half into a ball, lightly coat it with olive oil, and place it in an airtight container or zip-top bag.
- Store it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 3 months.
  - (If freezing, thaw overnight in the fridge before using.)

### 7. Prepare the Pizza:
- Preheat your oven to 245°C / 475°F.
- Roll out the dough for your first pizza to your desired thickness.
- Place it on a greased or parchment-lined pizza pan.
- Add your favorite sauce, cheese, and toppings.

### 8. Bake:
- Bake for 12–15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling.
- For extra crispiness, bake on a lower rack or preheated pizza stone.

### 9. Store Leftover Dough:
- When ready to use the second portion, allow it to come to room temperature (about 30 minutes) before shaping and baking.

### 10. Enjoy:
- Let the baked pizza cool slightly before slicing and serving.
