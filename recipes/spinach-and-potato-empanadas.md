# Spinach and Potato Empanadas

A savory, plant-based filling wrapped in crispy empanada dough.

## Ingredients (Makes about 10–12 empanadas)
### Filling:
- 3 medium potatoes, peeled and diced (450 g / 1 lb)
- 2 cups fresh spinach, chopped (60 g / 2 oz)
- 1 teaspoon paprika (2 g / 0.07 oz)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt (3 g / 0.1 oz)
- Olive oil spray

### Dough:
- 1 package frozen empanada dough (300 g / 10.5 oz), thawed

## Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Potato Filling
1. Boil diced potatoes in salted water until tender (about 10–12 minutes).
2. Drain and mash the potatoes, seasoning with paprika and salt.

### 2. Cook the Spinach
1. Heat a non-stick pan with a light spray of olive oil.
2. Sauté chopped spinach until wilted (about 2–3 minutes).
3. Mix the cooked spinach into the mashed potatoes, combining thoroughly.

### 3. Assemble the Empanadas
1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Roll out each empanada dough disc slightly to ensure even thickness.
3. Place 2 tablespoons (30 g / 1 oz) of the potato-spinach filling in the center of each disc.
4. Fold the dough over to form a half-moon shape, pressing the edges to seal.
5. Crimp the edges with a fork for a decorative finish.

### 4. Bake the Empanadas
1. Arrange the filled empanadas on the prepared baking sheet.
2. Lightly spray the tops with olive oil for a golden crust.
3. Bake for 20–25 minutes, or until the empanadas are crisp and golden brown.

### 5. Serve and Enjoy
- Let the empanadas cool for a few minutes before serving. These are great on their own or with a dipping sauce like tomato salsa or vegan sour cream.
