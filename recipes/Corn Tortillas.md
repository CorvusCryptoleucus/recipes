# Corn Tortillas

## Ingredients
- **240 g (2 cups)** masa harina
- **1/2 tsp** salt
- **355 ml (1 1/2 cups)** warm water

## Instructions
1. **Prepare the Dough**  
   - In a bowl, mix the masa harina and salt. Gradually add warm water while mixing until the dough is soft but not sticky. It should feel like Play-Doh.  
   - Cover the dough with a damp towel and let it rest for 15–30 minutes.

2. **Shape the Tortillas**  
   - Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces and roll each into a ball.  
   - Place a dough ball between two pieces of parchment paper or plastic wrap. Flatten it using a tortilla press or a rolling pin into a thin, round shape.

3. **Cook the Tortillas**  
   - Heat a dry skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Place a tortilla on the hot surface and cook for about 30–45 seconds on one side until the edges slightly curl.  
   - Flip and cook for another 30–45 seconds, then flip again for 15–30 seconds. The tortilla should puff slightly.  
   - Remove from the skillet and keep warm in a clean kitchen towel while cooking the remaining tortillas.

4. **Serve**  
   - Serve warm with your favorite fillings or toppings.
