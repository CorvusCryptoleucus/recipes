# Crispy Potato Taquitos

## Ingredients
- 600g (4 medium) potatoes, peeled and diced  
- 12 small (15 cm/6-inch) corn tortillas  
- 5g (1 tsp) garlic powder  
- 5g (1 tsp) cumin powder  
- 2g (1/2 tsp) chili powder  
- Salt and pepper, to taste  
- Oil for frying or baking  

## Instructions
1. Boil the potatoes in salted water until soft, about 10–15 minutes. Drain and mash with garlic powder, cumin, chili powder, salt, and pepper.
2. Warm tortillas in a dry skillet to make them pliable. Place 30g (2 tbsp) of the potato mixture on each tortilla, then roll tightly.
3. Fry the taquitos in hot oil until golden and crispy, or bake them at 200°C (400°F) for 20 minutes, turning halfway through.
4. Serve with guacamole, salsa, or vegan sour cream.
