## Instructions

### Prepare the Potatoes
1. **Peel and Grate**  
   Peel the russet potatoes and grate them using a box grater. Transfer the grated potatoes to a bowl of cold water and let sit for 5-10 minutes to remove excess starch.

2. **Rinse and Drain**  
   Drain the potatoes and rinse under cold water until the water runs clear. Transfer the grated potatoes to a clean kitchen towel or cheesecloth, then squeeze out as much water as possible.

### Mix the Hash Brown Base
3. **Combine Ingredients**  
   In a large mixing bowl, combine the grated potatoes, flour, vegetable oil, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika (if using), salt, and black pepper. Mix until evenly combined.

4. **Shape the Patties**  
   Divide the mixture into 6 equal portions. Shape each portion into a rectangular or oval patty, about 1 cm (1/3 inch) thick.

### Cook the Hash Browns
5. **Heat the Oil**  
   In a large skillet, heat vegetable oil over medium heat. Add enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan, about 2-3 mm (1/8 inch) deep.

6. **Fry the Hash Browns**  
   Place the patties in the hot oil, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Fry for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy.

7. **Drain the Hash Browns**  
   Transfer the cooked hash browns to a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.

### Serve

   Serve immediately as a side dish or include them in breakfast burritos or sandwiches for an authentic Taco Bell-inspired experience.

## Tips
- **Air Fryer Option:** Preheat your air fryer to 200°C (400°F). Spray the patties with oil and cook for 10-12 minutes, flipping halfway through.
- **Make Ahead:** Freeze uncooked patties on a baking sheet. Once frozen, store in an airtight container. Cook directly from frozen by frying or air frying.
