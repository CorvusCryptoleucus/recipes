    <h1>Pocket Pita Bread</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>240 g (2 cups)</strong> all-purpose flour (or a 50/50 mix of all-purpose and whole wheat flour)</li>
<li><strong>1/2 tsp</strong> salt</li>
<li><strong>7 g (2 1/4 tsp)</strong> active dry yeast</li>
<li><strong>5 g (1 tsp)</strong> sugar</li>
<li><strong>180 ml (3/4 cup)</strong> warm water (40°C/105°F)</li>
<li><strong>15 ml (1 tbsp)</strong> olive oil </li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Activate the Yeast</strong>  </li>
<li>
<p>In a small bowl, mix the yeast, sugar, and 60 ml (1/4 cup) of the warm water. Let it sit for 5–10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mix the Dough</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt.  </li>
<li>Add the activated yeast mixture, the remaining warm water, and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms.  </li>
<li>
<p>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 8–10 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>First Rise</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for 1–1.5 hours, or until it doubles in size.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Divide and Shape</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>Punch down the dough and divide it into 6–8 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball.  </li>
<li>
<p>Flatten each ball with a rolling pin into a disc about 1/4 inch (6 mm) thick and 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter. Cover the discs with a towel and let them rest for 15–20 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Preheat the Oven</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preheat your oven to <strong>250°C (480°F)</strong> or the highest setting. Place a baking stone or inverted baking sheet in the oven to preheat as well. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bake the Pita</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>Carefully place 2–3 dough discs onto the preheated stone or baking sheet. Bake for 3–5 minutes, or until they puff up completely. Do not overbake; they should remain soft and light golden.  </li>
<li>
<p>Remove from the oven and immediately wrap in a clean kitchen towel to keep them soft. Repeat with the remaining discs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Serve</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>Allow the pita to cool slightly before cutting. They will have formed pockets, perfect for stuffing with your favorite fillings like falafel, hummus, or vegetables.</li>
