# Flour Tortillas 

## Ingredients
- **240 g (2 cups)** all-purpose flour
- **1/2 tsp** salt
- **30 g (2 tbsp)** vegetable oil, coconut oil, or vegan shortening
- **180 ml (3/4 cup)** warm water

## Instructions
1. **Prepare the Dough**  
   - In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt.  
   - Add the vegetable oil (or other fat of choice) and mix with your hands or a fork until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  
   - Gradually add warm water, mixing until a soft, smooth dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour; if it’s too dry, add a small amount of water.

2. **Rest the Dough**  
   - Cover the dough with a damp towel and let it rest for 20–30 minutes. This makes the dough easier to roll out and ensures softer tortillas.

3. **Shape the Tortillas**  
   - Divide the dough into 8–12 equal pieces, depending on the desired size of your tortillas. Roll each piece into a ball.  
   - On a floured surface, roll each ball into a thin, round circle with a rolling pin. Aim for about 1/8-inch thickness or less.

4. **Cook the Tortillas**  
   - Heat a dry skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Place a tortilla on the hot skillet and cook for about 30–45 seconds on the first side until bubbles form.  
   - Flip the tortilla and cook for another 30–45 seconds, then flip again briefly to ensure even cooking. The tortilla should have light golden spots.  
   - Remove from the skillet and keep warm in a clean kitchen towel while cooking the remaining tortillas.

5. **Serve**  
   - Serve warm with your favorite fillings, as a wrap, or with dips. These tortillas are pliable, soft, and perfect for tacos, burritos, or as a bread substitute.
