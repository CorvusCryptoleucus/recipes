# Pocket Pita Bread

## Ingredients
- **240 g (2 cups)** all-purpose flour (or a 50/50 mix of all-purpose and whole wheat flour)
- **1/2 tsp** salt
- **7 g (2 1/4 tsp)** active dry yeast
- **5 g (1 tsp)** sugar
- **180 ml (3/4 cup)** warm water (40°C/105°F)
- **15 ml (1 tbsp)** olive oil 

## Instructions
1. **Activate the Yeast**  
   - In a small bowl, mix the yeast, sugar, and 60 ml (1/4 cup) of the warm water. Let it sit for 5–10 minutes until it becomes frothy.

2. **Mix the Dough**  
   - In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt.  
   - Add the activated yeast mixture, the remaining warm water, and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms.  
   - Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 8–10 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic.

3. **First Rise**  
   - Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for 1–1.5 hours, or until it doubles in size.

4. **Divide and Shape**  
   - Punch down the dough and divide it into 6–8 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball.  
   - Flatten each ball with a rolling pin into a disc about 1/4 inch (6 mm) thick and 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter. Cover the discs with a towel and let them rest for 15–20 minutes.

5. **Preheat the Oven**  
   - Preheat your oven to **250°C (480°F)** or the highest setting. Place a baking stone or inverted baking sheet in the oven to preheat as well. 

6. **Bake the Pita**  
   - Carefully place 2–3 dough discs onto the preheated stone or baking sheet. Bake for 3–5 minutes, or until they puff up completely. Do not overbake; they should remain soft and light golden.  
   - Remove from the oven and immediately wrap in a clean kitchen towel to keep them soft. Repeat with the remaining discs.

7. **Serve**  
   - Allow the pita to cool slightly before cutting. They will have formed pockets, perfect for stuffing with your favorite fillings like falafel, hummus, or vegetables.
