## Instructions

### Prepare the Beans
1. **Sort and Rinse**  
   Sort through the dried pinto beans to remove any debris or stones. Rinse the beans thoroughly under cold water.

2. **Soak the Beans**  
   Place the beans in a bowl and cover with water by at least 5 cm (2 inches). Let soak overnight (8-12 hours). For a quick soak, cover the beans with boiling water and let sit for 1 hour.

3. **Cook the Beans**  
   Drain the soaked beans and transfer them to a small pot. Add 500 ml (2 cups) of fresh water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer uncovered for 1-1.5 hours, or until the beans are tender. Add more water as needed to keep the beans submerged.

4. **Reserve Cooking Liquid**  
   Once the beans are tender, drain them, reserving 60 ml (1/4 cup) of the cooking liquid. Set aside.

### Make the Refried Beans
5. **Heat the Oil**  
   In a small skillet or saucepan, heat the vegetable oil or vegan butter over medium heat.

6. **Cook the Spices**  
   Add garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, smoked paprika, chili powder, and salt to the oil. Stir and cook for 30 seconds to bloom the spices.

7. **Mash the Beans**  
   Add the cooked pinto beans to the skillet. Use a potato masher or the back of a spoon to mash the beans until they reach your desired consistency.

8. **Add Liquid**  
   Stir in the reserved bean cooking liquid or vegetable broth, a little at a time, until the beans are creamy and smooth. Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.

9. **Taste and Adjust**  
   Taste the beans and adjust the seasonings as needed.
