**Servings:** 4 burritos

---

## Ingredients

### For the Burritos
- **4 large (25 cm / 10-inch)** flour tortillas
- **425 g (15 oz)** refried beans (canned or homemade)
- **240 ml (1 cup)** Taco Bell-style red sauce ([recipe here](#))
- **120 g (1 cup)** shredded cheddar cheese (or vegan alternative)
- **60 g (1/4 cup)** diced onions (optional)

---

## Instructions

1. **Warm the refried beans**  
   Heat the refried beans in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring occasionally, until smooth and warm.

2. **Warm the tortillas**  
   Heat the tortillas one at a time in a dry skillet over medium heat for about 10-15 seconds per side, or until warm and pliable. You can also wrap them in a damp paper towel and microwave for 15-20 seconds.

3. **Assemble the burritos**  
   Place a warm tortilla on a flat surface. Spread **100 g (1/2 cup)** of the refried beans down the center of the tortilla. Spoon **60 ml (1/4 cup)** of the Taco Bell-style red sauce over the beans.

4. **Add the cheese and onions**  
   Sprinkle **30 g (1/4 cup)** of shredded cheddar cheese over the beans and sauce. If using, add a small handful of diced onions.

5. **Roll the burritos**  
   Fold the sides of the tortilla inward, then roll it tightly from the bottom to form a burrito. Repeat for the remaining tortillas.

6. **Heat the burritos (optional)**  
   For a more authentic texture, place the assembled burritos in a dry skillet over medium heat for 1-2 minutes per side to lightly toast.

7. **Serve**  
   Serve immediately with your favorite sides like tortilla chips or a simple salad.
