## Instructions

### Make the Chalupa Shells
1. **Prepare the dough**  
   In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Cut in the vegan butter or shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add plant-based milk, stirring until a soft dough forms.

2. **Knead and rest**  
   Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 2-3 minutes until smooth. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let it rest for 10-15 minutes.

3. **Shape the shells**  
   Divide the dough into 6 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a circle about 15 cm (6 inches) in diameter.

4. **Fry the shells**  
   Heat oil in a deep skillet or pot to 180°C (350°F). Fry each shell one at a time, pressing gently in the center with tongs to create a slight indentation. Fry for 1-2 minutes per side until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.

### Make the TVP Taco Filling
5. **Rehydrate the TVP**  
   In a medium bowl, combine the TVP granules and hot vegetable broth. Stir and let sit for 5-10 minutes until the TVP absorbs the liquid and softens.

6. **Cook the TVP filling**  
   Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the rehydrated TVP and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently. Add chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, coriander, cayenne pepper (if using), soy sauce, and salt. Stir well and cook for an additional 5 minutes.

### Assemble the Chalupas
7. **Fill the shells**  
   Fill each fried chalupa shell with a generous scoop of the TVP filling. Top with shredded lettuce, shredded vegan cheese, diced tomatoes, and a dollop of vegan sour cream for a "supreme" experience.

8. **Serve**  
   Serve immediately with your favorite sides like rice, beans, or chips and salsa.
