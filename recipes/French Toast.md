# French Toast

## Ingredients
- **4 thick slices** of slightly stale French bread (1-inch thick)
- **240 ml (1 cup)** plant-based milk (e.g., almond, soy, or oat) 
- **2 tbsp** sugar (or maple syrup for natural sweetness)
- **1 tsp** vanilla extract
- **1/2 tsp** ground cinnamon
- **1/8 tsp** ground nutmeg (optional, for extra warmth)
- **2 tbsp** chickpea flour or cornstarch (vegan egg replacer)
- **Pinch of salt**
- **Vegan butter** or oil for greasing the skillet

## Instructions
1. **Prepare the Batter**  
   - In a shallow bowl or dish, whisk together the plant-based milk, sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg (if using), chickpea flour or cornstarch, and salt until smooth. Let it sit for a few minutes to thicken.

2. **Soak the Bread**  
   - Dip each slice of bread into the batter, letting it soak for about 30–60 seconds per side, ensuring it’s well-coated but not too soggy.

3. **Cook the French Toast**  
   - Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and grease with vegan butter or oil.  
   - Cook the soaked bread slices for 2–3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and slightly crispy.

4. **Serve**  
   - Serve immediately with toppings like powdered sugar, maple syrup, fresh fruit, or vegan whipped cream.
