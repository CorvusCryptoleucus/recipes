- 30 g (2 tbsp) sesame seeds
- 15 ml (1 tbsp) olive oil spray
- 120 ml (½ cup) vegetable broth
- 1 g (½ tsp) black salt
- 1 g (½ tsp) ground cumin
- 1 g (½ tsp) turmeric
- 1 g (½ tsp) chili powder

## Instructions
1. Press the tofu to remove excess water, then cut it into cubes.
2. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and spray lightly with olive oil.
3. Add the tofu cubes to the skillet and cook for 5–7 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden and crispy on all sides.
4. Reduce heat to medium. Stir in sesame seeds, black salt, cumin, turmeric, and chili powder.
