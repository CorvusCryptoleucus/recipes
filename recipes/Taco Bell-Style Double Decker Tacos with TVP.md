## Instructions

1. **Rehydrate the TVP**  
   In a medium bowl, combine the TVP granules and hot vegetable broth. Stir and let sit for 5-10 minutes until the TVP absorbs the liquid and softens.

2. **Cook the TVP filling**  
   Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the rehydrated TVP and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently. Add chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, coriander, cayenne pepper (if using), soy sauce, and salt. Stir well to combine and cook for another 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to blend.

3. **Prepare the tortillas**  
   Spread a thin layer of warm refried beans on each soft flour tortilla. Place a crunchy taco shell in the center of each tortilla and fold the tortilla around the shell, pressing gently to adhere the beans to the shell.

4. **Assemble the double-decker tacos**  
   Fill each crunchy shell with a generous scoop of the TVP filling. Top with shredded lettuce, shredded vegan cheese, and optional toppings like diced tomatoes and a dollop of vegan sour cream for a "supreme" experience.

5. **Serve**  
   Serve the double-decker tacos immediately with sides like tortilla chips, rice, or beans.
