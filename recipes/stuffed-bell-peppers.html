<li>4 large bell peppers (any color)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Filling</h3>
<ul>
<li>200 g (1 cup) cooked jasmine brown rice or long-grain white rice</li>
<li>75 g (1 cup) TVP (Textured Vegetable Protein), rehydrated</li>
<li>130 g (1 cup) black beans, cooked (or canned, drained and rinsed)</li>
<li>75 g (1/2 cup) super sweet whole kernel corn</li>
<li>100 g (1/2 cup) diced tomatoes, drained</li>
<li>75 g (1/2 cup) frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained</li>
<li>30 g (1/4 cup) hemp hearts (optional, for added protein and texture)</li>
<li>2.5 g (1/2 tsp) ground cumin</li>
<li>2.5 g (1/2 tsp) paprika</li>
<li>2.5 g (1/2 tsp) turmeric</li>
<li>1.25 g (1/4 tsp) chili powder (adjust to taste)</li>
<li>1.25 g (1/4 tsp) cinnamon (optional, for warmth)</li>
<li>2 g (1/4 tsp) black salt</li>
<li>1 g (1/4 tsp) regular salt, or to taste</li>
<li>120 ml (1/2 cup) vegetable broth (to moisten the filling, as needed)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Topping</h3>
<ul>
<li>15 g (2 tbsp) sesame seeds (optional, for garnish)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<h3>Prepare the Bell Peppers</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preheat your oven to 190°C (375°F).</li>
<li>Cut the tops off the bell peppers and remove seeds and membranes. Set the tops aside for presentation if desired.</li>
<li>Lightly rub the outside of the peppers with a bit of oil or spray with vegetable broth to prevent drying.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Cook the Rice</h3>
<ol>
<li>Cook 100 g (1/2 cup) of rice (jasmine brown or long-grain white) according to package instructions. This will yield about 200 g (1 cup) of cooked rice.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Rehydrate the TVP</h3>
<ol>
<li>Place 75 g (1 cup) of TVP in a bowl and cover with 120 ml (1/2 cup) of hot vegetable broth. Let sit for 5–10 minutes until fully rehydrated, then fluff with a fork.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Prepare the Filling</h3>
<ol>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked rice, rehydrated TVP, black beans, corn, diced tomatoes, spinach, and hemp hearts.</li>
<li>Add the ground cumin, paprika, turmeric, chili powder, cinnamon (if using), black salt, and regular salt. Mix thoroughly.</li>
<li>Add vegetable broth as needed to moisten the filling slightly—it should hold together when pressed but not be soggy.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Stuff the Peppers</h3>
<ol>
<li>Fill each bell pepper with the prepared mixture, packing it lightly but firmly.</li>
<li>Sprinkle sesame seeds over the top for added texture, if desired.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Bake</h3>
<ol>
<li>Place the stuffed peppers upright in a baking dish. Add about 5 mm (1/4 inch) of vegetable broth or water to the bottom of the dish to keep the peppers moist.</li>
<li>Cover the dish with foil and bake for 25–30 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10–15 minutes, until the peppers are tender and slightly charred on the edges.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Serve Now</h3>
<ol>
<li>Serve one stuffed pepper immediately while warm. Optionally garnish with a sprinkle of garam masala or fresh herbs.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Store for Later</h3>
<ol>
<li>Allow the remaining three stuffed peppers to cool to room temperature.</li>
<li>Place each stuffed pepper in an airtight container or wrap tightly with foil/plastic wrap. Store in the refrigerator for up to 3–4 days.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Reheating Instructions</h3>
<h4>Oven:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 175°C (350°F).</li>
<li>Place the stuffed pepper in an oven-safe dish and cover with foil to retain moisture.</li>
<li>Heat for 20–25 minutes, or until warmed through.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Microwave:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Place the stuffed pepper on a microwave-safe plate.</li>
<li>Cover with a microwave-safe lid or loosely with a damp paper towel.</li>
<li>Heat on medium power for 2–3 minutes, checking and rotating halfway through.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Stovetop (Optional):</h4>
<ol>
<li>Slice the stuffed pepper in half and reheat in a skillet over medium heat with a splash of vegetable broth to keep it moist.</li>
<li>Cover and heat for about 5 minutes.</li>
</ol>
