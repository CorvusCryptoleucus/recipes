## Instructions

1. **Rehydrate the TVP**  
   In a medium bowl, combine the TVP granules and hot vegetable broth. Stir and let sit for 5-10 minutes until the TVP absorbs the liquid and softens.

2. **Cook the TVP filling**  
   Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the rehydrated TVP and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently. Add chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, coriander, cayenne pepper (if using), soy sauce, and salt. Stir well to combine and cook for another 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to blend.

3. **Warm the tortillas**  
   Heat the tortillas in a dry skillet over medium heat for 10-15 seconds per side or wrap them in a damp paper towel and microwave for 15-20 seconds.

4. **Assemble the tacos**  
   Place a generous scoop of the TVP filling in the center of each tortilla. Top with shredded lettuce, and shredded vegan cheese. For a "supreme" experience, add diced tomatoes and a dollop of vegan sour cream. Add hot sauce if desired.

5. **Serve**  
   Fold the tacos in half and serve immediately with your favorite side dishes like tortilla chips, rice, or beans.
