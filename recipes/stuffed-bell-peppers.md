# Stuffed Bell Peppers

**Yield:** 4 stuffed bell peppers.

## Ingredients
### Bell Peppers
- 4 large bell peppers (any color)

### Filling
- 200 g (1 cup) cooked jasmine brown rice or long-grain white rice
- 75 g (1 cup) TVP (Textured Vegetable Protein), rehydrated
- 130 g (1 cup) black beans, cooked (or canned, drained and rinsed)
- 75 g (1/2 cup) super sweet whole kernel corn
- 100 g (1/2 cup) diced tomatoes, drained
- 75 g (1/2 cup) frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
- 30 g (1/4 cup) hemp hearts (optional, for added protein and texture)
- 2.5 g (1/2 tsp) ground cumin
- 2.5 g (1/2 tsp) paprika
- 2.5 g (1/2 tsp) turmeric
- 1.25 g (1/4 tsp) chili powder (adjust to taste)
- 1.25 g (1/4 tsp) cinnamon (optional, for warmth)
- 2 g (1/4 tsp) black salt
- 1 g (1/4 tsp) regular salt, or to taste
- 120 ml (1/2 cup) vegetable broth (to moisten the filling, as needed)

### Topping
- 15 g (2 tbsp) sesame seeds (optional, for garnish)

## Instructions
### Prepare the Bell Peppers
1. Preheat your oven to 190°C (375°F).
2. Cut the tops off the bell peppers and remove seeds and membranes. Set the tops aside for presentation if desired.
3. Lightly rub the outside of the peppers with a bit of oil or spray with vegetable broth to prevent drying.

### Cook the Rice
1. Cook 100 g (1/2 cup) of rice (jasmine brown or long-grain white) according to package instructions. This will yield about 200 g (1 cup) of cooked rice.

### Rehydrate the TVP
1. Place 75 g (1 cup) of TVP in a bowl and cover with 120 ml (1/2 cup) of hot vegetable broth. Let sit for 5–10 minutes until fully rehydrated, then fluff with a fork.

### Prepare the Filling
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked rice, rehydrated TVP, black beans, corn, diced tomatoes, spinach, and hemp hearts.
2. Add the ground cumin, paprika, turmeric, chili powder, cinnamon (if using), black salt, and regular salt. Mix thoroughly.
3. Add vegetable broth as needed to moisten the filling slightly—it should hold together when pressed but not be soggy.

### Stuff the Peppers
1. Fill each bell pepper with the prepared mixture, packing it lightly but firmly.
2. Sprinkle sesame seeds over the top for added texture, if desired.

### Bake
1. Place the stuffed peppers upright in a baking dish. Add about 5 mm (1/4 inch) of vegetable broth or water to the bottom of the dish to keep the peppers moist.
2. Cover the dish with foil and bake for 25–30 minutes.
3. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10–15 minutes, until the peppers are tender and slightly charred on the edges.

### Serve Now
1. Serve one stuffed pepper immediately while warm. Optionally garnish with a sprinkle of garam masala or fresh herbs.

### Store for Later
1. Allow the remaining three stuffed peppers to cool to room temperature.
2. Place each stuffed pepper in an airtight container or wrap tightly with foil/plastic wrap. Store in the refrigerator for up to 3–4 days.

### Reheating Instructions
#### Oven:
1. Preheat the oven to 175°C (350°F).
2. Place the stuffed pepper in an oven-safe dish and cover with foil to retain moisture.
3. Heat for 20–25 minutes, or until warmed through.

#### Microwave:
1. Place the stuffed pepper on a microwave-safe plate.
2. Cover with a microwave-safe lid or loosely with a damp paper towel.
3. Heat on medium power for 2–3 minutes, checking and rotating halfway through.

#### Stovetop (Optional):
1. Slice the stuffed pepper in half and reheat in a skillet over medium heat with a splash of vegetable broth to keep it moist.
2. Cover and heat for about 5 minutes.

Enjoy this flavorful meal fresh or as a convenient make-ahead dish!
