## Ingredients

- **195 g (1 cup)** cooked black beans (or canned, drained and rinsed)
- **187.5 g (3/4 cup)** super sweet whole kernel corn

2. **Prepare the bean and vegetable mixture**:
   - In a large skillet over medium heat, combine the black beans, corn, diced tomatoes, cumin, and chili powder. Stir well to combine.
   - Cook for about 5–7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until heated through.

3. **Assemble the bowl**:

   - Spoon the bean and vegetable mixture over the rice.
   - Add salt to taste.

4. **Optional**: Top with plant-based mozzarella, salsa, or sliced olives for added flavor.
