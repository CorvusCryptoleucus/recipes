# Lebanese Pita Bread Recipe

## Ingredients
- **500 g (4 cups)** all-purpose flour (or 50/50 mix of all-purpose and whole wheat flour)
- **7 g (2 tsp)** salt
- **7 g (2 1/4 tsp)** active dry yeast
- **5 g (1 tsp)** sugar
- **300 ml (1 1/4 cups)** warm water (40°C/105°F)
- **15 ml (1 tbsp)** olive oil

## Instructions
1. **Activate the Yeast**  
   - In a small bowl, mix the yeast and sugar with warm water. Let it sit for 5–10 minutes until frothy.

2. **Mix and Knead**  
   - In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt.  
   - Add the activated yeast mixture and olive oil (if using).  
   - Mix until a dough forms, then knead on a floured surface for 8–10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic.

3. **First Rise**  
   - Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for 1–1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.

4. **Divide and Shape**  
   - Punch down the dough and divide it into 8 equal portions.  
   - Roll each portion into a ball, then flatten into a disc about 6–7 inches in diameter and 1/4 inch thick.

5. **Preheat the Oven**  
   - Preheat to **250°C (480°F)** or the highest setting. Place a baking stone or an inverted baking sheet in the oven to heat.

6. **Bake the Pita**  
   - Place the discs onto the preheated stone or baking sheet. Bake for 3–5 minutes, or until they puff up and lightly brown.

7. **Cool**  
   - Remove and cool under a clean towel to keep soft.
